  <p>This is a career change for me, my interests have changed more towards computers and security.
    First all I am mixture of self-taught and experience on the job. I have done courses in software
    development and Networks. I have learned a multitude of coding languages, some include:
    HTML, Javascript, CSS, php, Python and Ruby etc. I have had some network experience in Cisco (CCNA)
    and CompTia. I didn't receive certificates with these subjects but I wish to develop my skills
    further with employment success. Worked on projects with Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn app and started on
    Github. Currently doing tasks and projects on DataCamp so will hopefully have certificates with those
    c ourses.
